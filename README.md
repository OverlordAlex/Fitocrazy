# Known Bugs
BUG: "enter" when creating a new exercise component does weird stuff (should trim+enter)

# TODO
- when editing a component that causes the list of components of that type to be reordered, that refresh should refresh a range and not entire dataset
- be able to edit date on workout
- auto migrate DB / reset DB
- Bodyweight - what kg to enter?
- need to be able to delete components (wants to put "seated" first on "seated dumbbell arnold press"
- add average weight per set and rep in the workout overview page
- basic weight tracking
- better icons for navigation panes
- exercise + component editor
- profile page
- better text for the notification action
- allow editing of exercise components
- add graphs for exercise history
- profile statistics
- better logo and splash screen
- fix icon (lighter background, missing shine on second stickout on F)
- - add a dumbbell in bottom right of logo
- better font
- the weight + reps enters should have more strict validation provided by android itself?
- better icons for achievements
- icon to indicate time can be paused
- number of sets at current weight in notification should be displayed better (closer to the weight?)
- dont show achievements on first instance of that exercise ever (no history)
- - should achievements be per-row? or at least on the set card itself?
- records should live with their exercises forever

# Out of Scope
- tint of chips should be per bodypart - right now its ordered by most frequent
- bring points to the spinners on exercise type for more flexibility?
- most common exercises should be based on similar exercises already in workout?
- total points per exercise in chip next to exercise name (floating popups enough?)
