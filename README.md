# Known Bugs
BUG: "enter" when creating a new exercise component does weird stuff (should trim+enter)
BUG: focus is set to autocomplete on addnewexercise when a component has been added and popup closed
BUG: adding first set is swallowed when rep edit text has focus (toast shows! inputs cleared) - related to achievements? worked on latest exercise but not earlier
- BUG: I have animations turned off... lol
Bug: total set time doesn't count when in background
Bug: app not installed when starting from bottom bar icon


# TODO
- manage time, and saving time
- Scroll to top when adding new exercise <- because no animations?
- Total sets in exercise so far would be nice
- Calculation should be based more heavily on weight over reps
- Changing date on workout should set total time to 0
- When going to old exercise and back, then should scroll to where it was clicked from in the list
- add exercise to current workout from search in other list
- up next, charts!
- multiple of same set should show better in current workout (collapse?)
- move from a group selecter to a difficulty selector that includes bodyweight
- action bar on workout could use better styling (, back button, etc)
- spinners should be searchable
- nicer page scrolling animations between tabs on "exercises"
- when pressing a chip for the number of times that exercise was done, open a view of the exercises when it was last seen
- Bodyweight - what kg to enter?
- add average weight per set and rep in the workout overview page
- basic weight tracking
- better icons for navigation panes
- profile page
- better text for the notification action
- add graphs for exercise history
- profile statistics
- better logo and splash screen
- fix icon (lighter background, missing shine on second stickout on F)
- - add a dumbbell in bottom right of logo
- better font
- better icons for achievements
- timer pause icon should be closer to time, better styled, and timer started/stops when pressing anywhere in layout
- number of sets at current weight in notification should be displayed better (closer to the weight?)


# Out of Scope
- tint of chips should be per bodypart - right now its ordered by most frequent
- bring points to the spinners on exercise type for more flexibility?
- most common exercises should be based on similar exercises already in workout?
- BUG: buttons dont line up with spinners in adding exercise (problem only if the spinner is empty) - should happen once in entire app lifecycle
- workout creation based on body part (not needed - can create via search by bodypart on adding exercises)
